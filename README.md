Important notes for config

Make sure you run container 0 / setup its container id and that you have filled in terraform.tfvars properly in the dir with the directory of where your proxmox / id_rsa key is. Also important to at some point replace the EOT so that the pub key is placed in varfile

Need to move all ip's to be set outside of the module
